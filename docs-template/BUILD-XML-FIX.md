# GitHub Actions Fix: build.xml Missing Issue

## Problem
GitHub Actions deployment failed with error:
```
ls: cannot access 'build.xml': No such file or directory
```

The `build.xml` file was missing from the GitHub Actions checkout, even though it exists in the local repository and is tracked by git.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `build.xml` file exists locally and is properly tracked by git
2. The GitHub Actions checkout was not properly retrieving the file
3. This could be due to:
   - Checkout action caching issues
   - `.gitignore` configuration problems
   - Git LFS or other git configuration issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Checkout Action
```yaml
- name: Checkout Repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    clean: true  # ← Added clean flag
```

### 2. build.xml Verification and Fallback
Added comprehensive verification logic:
```bash
if [ -f "build.xml" ]; then
  echo "✅ build.xml found"
else
  echo "❌ build.xml missing!"
  if [ -f "build.xml.backup" ]; then
    echo "Found build.xml.backup, copying it to build.xml"
    cp build.xml.backup build.xml
  fi
fi
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed directory listings
- Explicit file existence checks
- Step-by-step verification process

### 4. Improved Troubleshooting Tools
- Updated `check-deployment-requirements.sh` to verify git tracking
- Added specific troubleshooting section in README
- Documented fallback mechanism

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` - Main workflow fix
- `docs-template/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Synchronized copy
- `docs-template/check-deployment-requirements.sh` - Enhanced validation
- `docs-template/README.md` - Updated troubleshooting guide

## Expected Result
The GitHub Actions workflow should now:
1. ✅ Properly check out all files including `build.xml`
2. ✅ Verify `build.xml` exists before compilation
3. ✅ Fall back to `build.xml.backup` if needed
4. ✅ Provide detailed logging for debugging
5. ✅ Successfully compile CircuitJS1 for production

## Testing
- Local verification shows `build.xml` is properly tracked
- Fallback logic tested locally
- Enhanced logging will show exactly what's happening in GitHub Actions
