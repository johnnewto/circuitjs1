## Welcome to CircuitJS

CircuitJS is an ecomonics  circuit simulator that runs in web browsers. It was originally written by Paul Falstad as an electronic Java Applet and adapted by Iain Sharp to run in modern browsers using Google Web Toolkit (GWT).

## Quick Start
Ready to start simulating circuits? [Launch the CircuitJS App](app.qmd) or browse our [examples](docs/examples.qmd).
:::

## Features

- **Real-time simulation** of Economics, analog, digital circuits
- **Economics & System Dynamics** modeling capabilities:
  - Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) modeling inspired by [Steve Keen's Minsky program](docs/sfc-modeling.qmd)
  - Stock-flow analysis with integrated balance sheets
  - Table elements for accounting equations (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
  - Pre-built BOMD (Bank Originated Money and Debt) models
  - Support for monetary economics and sectoral balances
  - [Learn more about SFC modeling →](docs/sfc-modeling.qmd)
- **Interactive components** - drag, connect, and modify circuit elements
- **Oscilloscope display** with multiple channels
- **Extensive component library** including:
  - Passive components (resistors, capacitors, inductors)
  - Active components (transistors, op-amps, logic gates)
  - Voltage and current sources
  - Mathematical & economics components (adders, multipliers, dividers, differentiators)
  - Data management tools (Tables with equation support, stock-flow modeling)
  - Measurement tools (voltmeters, ammeters, percent/ratio meters)
- **Save and load circuits** in multiple formats
- **Educational examples** covering basic electronics to economic modeling
