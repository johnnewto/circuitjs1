## Economics & System Dynamics Models

CircuitJS1 includes specialized components for economic modeling using stock-flow analysis. These models demonstrate the application of system dynamics to monetary economics and accounting.

### BOMD (Bank Originated Money and Debt) Model

A comprehensive model of bank lending and money creation in a simplified economy.

**File:** `econ_BOMD.txt`
**[Load Model](https://johnnewto.github.io/circuitjs1/circuitjs.html?startCircuit=econ_BOMD.txt)**
```
Components:
- Banks Table (with Reserves, Debt to Savers/Borrowers, Equity)
- Borrowers Table (Borrowers Debt and Equity)
- Savers Table (Savings and Equity)
- Mathematical elements (Multipliers, Adders)
- Percent/Ratio meters for analysis
```

**Key Features:**
- Three-sector economy: Banks, Borrowers, Savers
- Lending dynamics with interest payments
- Bank spending and money velocity
- Accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Stock-flow consistency

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand endogenous money creation
- Track money flows between sectors
- Observe stock-flow accounting principles
- Analyze interest rate effects on debt dynamics

**Key Parameters:**
- Interest Rate: 5% (configurable)
- Lending Fraction: 2% of GDP (configurable)
- Velocity: 0.5 (money circulation speed)
- Bank Spend Rate: 10% (how fast banks spend reserves)
- Fee Rate: 0.5 (transaction fees)

### BOMD Simple Model

A simplified version focusing on core banking operations.

**File:** `econ_BOMDSimple.txt`
**[Load Model](https://johnnewto.github.io/circuitjs1/circuitjs.html?startCircuit=econ_BOMDSimple.txt)**

```
Components:
- Banks Table (Loans, Deposits, Equity)
- Non-Bank Private Sector Table (Deposits, Loans, Equity)
- Differentiator for GDP calculation
- Divider for velocity computation
```

**Simplified Focus:**
- Two-sector model: Banks and Private Sector
- Direct lending relationship
- GDP derived from money velocity (M×V)
- Credit creation through bank loans

**Key Concepts:**
- Bank credit creates deposits
- Loans create deposits (not vice versa)
- GDP = Money Supply × Velocity
- Balance sheet symmetry between sectors

**Use Cases:**
- Teaching basic banking operations
- Understanding credit money creation
- Observing GDP-debt relationships
- Analyzing velocity effects

### BOMD with Government

Extended model including government sector and central bank operations.

**File:** `econ_BOMDwithGovt.txt`

**[Load Model](https://johnnewto.github.io/circuitjs1/circuitjs.html?startCircuit=econ_BOMDwithGovt.txt)**

```
Components:
- Banks Table (7 columns: Reserves, Debt, Gov Bonds, etc.)
- Borrowers Table (with tax and government spending flows)
- Savers Table (with tax and government spending flows)
- Treasury Table (Government bonds and equity)
- The Fed Table (Central bank reserves and operations)
```

**Extended Features:**
- Five-sector economy: Banks, Borrowers, Savers, Treasury, Federal Reserve
- Government spending and taxation
- Bond issuance and interest payments
- Central bank reserve management
- Complete sectoral accounting

**Government Operations:**
- Tax collection from all sectors
- Government spending (distribution configurable)
- Bond sales to finance deficits
- Interest payments on bonds
- Central bank monetary operations

**Advanced Concepts:**
- Fiscal policy effects on private sector
- Government deficit = Private sector surplus
- Bond market operations
- Reserve management by central bank
- Sectoral financial balances

**Policy Experiments:**
- Adjust tax rates and observe sector balances
- Change government spending levels
- Modify bond interest rates
- Analyze deficit spending effects

### How to Load These Models

1. **From Circuit Files:**

   - Use File → Import in CircuitJS1

2. **From Web Interface:**
   - Circuits > Ecomonics >
   - Click on the desired file
   - Circuit loads automatically

3. **Experiment & Modify:**
   - Adjust interest rates and lending fractions
   - Change spending and tax rates
   - Add scope traces to monitor key variables
   - Export modified circuits for sharing

### Understanding the Economics Elements

These models use specialized CircuitJS1 components:

- **Table Elements**: Represent balance sheets with Assets, Liabilities, Equity
- **Godly Tables**: Include integration for stock accumulation over time
- **Multipliers/Dividers**: Calculate derived variables (interest, fees, ratios)
- **Adders/Subtractors**: Compute net flows between accounts
- **Percent Meters**: Display ratios and rates
- **Stop Time**: Halt simulation at specific time points

### Educational Applications

**Undergraduate Economics:**
- Money and banking fundamentals
- Stock-flow consistent modeling
- Sectoral accounting principles

**Graduate/Research:**
- Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) concepts
- Post-Keynesian economics
- Endogenous money dynamics
- Fiscal-monetary policy interactions

**Policy Analysis:**
- Government deficit effects
- Interest rate impacts
- Credit cycle dynamics
- Debt sustainability
