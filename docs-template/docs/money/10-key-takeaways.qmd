## Summary

1. **Structure Matters**: The location of debt on balance sheets (Loanable Funds vs. BOMD) completely changes system dynamics

2. **Accounting Identity**: Government deficit = Private sector surplus (always true, regardless of model)

3. **Money Creation**: In BOMD, both credit and government deficits create money; in Loanable Funds, money is only redistributed

4. **Crisis Predictions**: 
   - Loanable Funds → inevitable crisis with sustained deficits
   - BOMD → stable debt/GDP ratio with sustained deficits

5. **Evidence**: Central banks endorse BOMD model; real-world operations match BOMD, not Loanable Funds

6. **Policy Implications**: Believing the wrong model leads to harmful policies (e.g., austerity reducing private wealth)
