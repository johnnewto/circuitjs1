*Based on Steve Keen's analysis for engineers*

This series breaks down the fundamental principles of money, banking, and government finance using first-principles reasoning and CircuitJS simulations.

*This analysis demonstrates that first-principles reasoning, grounded in double-entry bookkeeping, leads to radically different conclusions than reasoning by analogy from households to governments.*
