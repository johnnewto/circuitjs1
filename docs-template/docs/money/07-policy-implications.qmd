## If Loanable Funds is Correct:
- Government deficits crowd out private investment
- Debt accumulation is unsustainable
- Austerity is necessary to avoid crisis
- Government must "live within its means"

## If BOMD is Correct:
- Government deficits add to private sector wealth
- Debt/GDP ratio stabilizes naturally
- Austerity reduces private sector equity
- Government cannot "run out of money" (for fiat currency issuer)

## The Evidence

Central bank endorsements:
- **Bank of England** (2014): "Bank lending creates deposits"
- **Bundesbank** (2017): "A bank can grant loans without any prior inflows"

Empirical observation:
- Banks create loans and deposits simultaneously
- Government spending precedes taxation operationally
- Countries with sovereign currencies never "run out of money"

**Conclusion**: Evidence strongly supports BOMD model.
