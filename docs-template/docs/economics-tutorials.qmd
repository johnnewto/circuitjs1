## Introduction to Economics in CircuitJS

CircuitJS has been extended with powerful tools for economic modeling, particularly Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) analysis inspired by Steve Keen's Minsky program. These tutorials will guide you through building economic models using circuit simulation concepts.

### Tutorial Overview

- **Tutorials 1-3**: Getting started with basic concepts (bank accounts, double-entry bookkeeping, banking systems)
- **Tutorial 4**: **Money from First Principles** - Compare Loanable Funds vs. Endogenous Money models to understand money creation and government deficits (based on Steve Keen's analysis for engineers)
- **Tutorials 6-8**: Intermediate to advanced models (debt dynamics, business cycles, international trade)
- **Tutorials 9-11**: Mathematical tools and practical applications (MMT, climate economics)

### Key Concepts

- **Stocks**: Accumulations (bank accounts, inventory, population)
- **Flows**: Rates of change (transactions, production, consumption)
- **Consistency**: All flows must come from somewhere and go somewhere
- **Balance Sheets**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

---

## Getting Started with Economic Modeling

### Tutorial 1: Your First Economic Model - Simple Bank Account

Learn the basics by modeling a bank account with deposits and withdrawals.

#### What You'll Learn
- How to use Table elements for accounting
- Creating stock variables
- Modeling flows
- Maintaining stock-flow consistency

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Start with a New Circuit**
   - Open CircuitJS
   - Clear the canvas (File > New)

2. **Add a Table Element**
   - Right-click on empty space
   - Navigate to: **Economics > Table** (or press 'g' for Godly Table)
   - Place the table on canvas

3. **Configure the Table**
   - Right-click the table and select **Edit**
   - Set title: "Bank Account"
   - Configure 1 stock column: "Deposits"
   - Add rows for:
     - Initial balance: 1000
     - Income flow: 100
     - Spending flow: -80



5. **Run the Simulation**
   - Press **Run** to start
   - Watch the Deposits column accumulate over time
   - Net flow = 100 - 80 = 20 per time period

#### What's Happening?
- The stock (Deposits) integrates the net flow over time
- Starting from 1000, it increases by 20 each time period
- This demonstrates the fundamental stock-flow relationship: dStock/dt = Flow

---

### Tutorial 2: Double-Entry Bookkeeping

Model a complete balance sheet using Assets, Liabilities, and Equity.

#### Theory Review
- **Accounting Identity**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity (A = L + E)
- Every transaction affects at least two accounts
- The identity must hold at all times

#### Building the Model

1. **Create a Godly Table**
   - Right-click: **Economics > Godly Table** (or press 'g')
   - This provides automatic stock-flow integration

2. **Set Up Columns**
   - Column 1: Assets (type: Asset)
   - Column 2: Liabilities (type: Liability)
   - Column 3: Equity (type: Equity)

3. **Add Initial Values**
   - Assets: 1000
   - Liabilities: 600
   - Equity: 400
   - Verify: 1000 = 600 + 400 ✓

4. **Add Transaction Rows**
   - Row 1: Purchase on credit
     - Assets: +100 (inventory)
     - Liabilities: +100 (accounts payable)
     - Equity: 0
   - Row 2: Sales revenue
     - Assets: +150 (cash)
     - Liabilities: 0
     - Equity: +150 (profit)

5. **Verify Consistency**
   - Use **Economics > Current Transactions Matrix** to visualize flows
   - Watch the balance sheet remain balanced during simulation
   - Assets should always equal Liabilities + Equity

#### Key Learning Points
- Double-entry ensures consistency
- Each transaction preserves the accounting identity
- Stocks accumulate flows over time
- The system is always in balance

---

### Tutorial 3: Banking System - Money Creation

Model how banks create money through lending (BOMD - Bank Originated Money and Debt).

#### Sectors in the Model
- **Banks**: Create deposits and loans
- **Firms**: Borrow for investment
- **Households**: Earn wages, consume

#### Part A: Simple Bank Lending

1. **Set Up the Bank Balance Sheet**
   - Assets: Loans to firms
   - Liabilities: Deposits
   - Equity: Bank capital

2. **Model the Lending Process**
   - When bank makes a loan:
     - Bank Assets (Loans): +1000
     - Bank Liabilities (Deposits): +1000
   - Money is created simultaneously!

3. **Use Flow Master and Stock Master**
   - Right-click: **Economics > Flow Master**
   - Right-click: **Economics > Stock Master**
   - These coordinate the stock-flow dynamics

4. **Add Interest Flows**
   - Firms pay interest on loans
   - Interest flows from firm deposits to bank equity
   - Use Percent Meter to calculate interest: rate × principal

#### Part B: Complete Three-Sector Model

1. **Add Firm Sector**
   - Assets: Capital equipment, cash
   - Liabilities: Bank loans
   - Equity: Firm net worth

2. **Add Household Sector**
   - Assets: Bank deposits
   - Liabilities: None (or household debt)
   - Equity: Household net worth

3. **Connect the Flows**
   - Wages: Firm equity → Household deposits
   - Consumption: Household deposits → Firm equity
   - Investment: Firm deposits → Firm capital
   - Loan creation: Bank creates deposits and loans

4. **Verify Sectoral Balances**
   - Sum of all sectors' net worth = 0 (closed system)
   - Use Current Transactions Matrix to visualize
   - All flows must be accounted for

---

## Intermediate Economic Models

### Tutorial 4: Money from First Principles - Loanable Funds vs. Endogenous Money

Build and compare two competing models of banking to understand money creation, based on Steve Keen's analysis.

#### Theory: Two Models of Banking

There are two fundamentally different views of how banking works:

1. **Loanable Funds**: Banks are intermediaries between savers and borrowers
   - Deposits come first, loans follow
   - Banks lend out existing money
   - Government deficits "crowd out" private investment
   - Fiscal crisis inevitable with sustained deficits

2. **Endogenous Money (BOMD)**: Banks create money by creating debt
   - Loans create deposits simultaneously
   - Banks originate money, don't intermediate it
   - Government deficits add to private sector wealth
   - No inherent fiscal crisis from deficits

#### Part A: Building the Loanable Funds Model

**Key Principle**: In Loanable Funds, loans appear as assets of households and liabilities of firms, NOT on bank balance sheets as assets.

1. **Create Three Godly Tables**
   - **Private Banks Table**:
     - Assets: Reserves
     - Liabilities: Households, Firms
     - Equity: BanksEquity
   - **Households Table**:
     - Assets: Households (deposits), DebtFirms (loans to firms)
     - Liabilities: None
     - Equity: HHEquity
   - **Firms Table**:
     - Assets: Firms (deposits)
     - Liabilities: DebtFirms (borrowed from households)
     - Equity: FirmsEquity

2. **Add Basic Flows (Without Government)**
   - **Wages**: Firms → Households
     - Use Divider: Firms / τFirms × WageShare
     - τFirms ≈ 0.25 (firms spend deposits quarterly)
     - WageShare ≈ 0.6 (60% of GDP goes to wages)
   - **Consumption**: Households → Firms
     - Use Divider: Households / τHH
     - τHH ≈ 0.5 (households spend deposits biannually)
   - **Credit**: Households → Firms (intermediated)
     - Use Multiplier: GDP × CreditShare
     - CreditShare ≈ 0.5 (50% of GDP)
   - **Interest on Loans**: Firms → Households
     - Use Multiplier: DebtFirms × IntRate
     - IntRate ≈ 0.05 (5% per year)
   - **Bank Fees**: Households → Banks
     - Use Multiplier: Interest × FeeFrac
     - FeeFrac ≈ 0.1 (10% of interest as fees)

3. **Run Initial Simulation**
   - Set up scopes to monitor:
     - GDP (total firm deposits / τFirms)
     - Household deposits
     - Firm debt
   - Observe: System is sustainable without government

4. **Add Government Sector**
   - **Treasury Table**:
     - Assets: Government (account at private banks)
     - Liabilities: DebtGov (bonds held by households)
     - Equity: TreasuryEquity
   - Add flows:
     - **Tax**: Households → Government
       - Use Multiplier: GDP × TaxRate (e.g., 0.2 for 20%)
     - **Government Spending**: Government → Firms
       - Use Multiplier: GDP × SpendRate (e.g., 0.21 for 21%)
     - **Bond Sales**: Households → Government
       - Must equal: Deficit + Interest on existing bonds
       - Use Adder: (SpendGov - Tax) + (DebtGov × IntRate)
     - **Interest on Bonds**: Government → Households
       - Use Multiplier: DebtGov × IntRate

5. **Observe the Crisis**
   - Run with 1% deficit (SpendRate = 0.21, TaxRate = 0.2)
   - Watch over 200+ years:
     - Government debt grows exponentially
     - Eventually exceeds 2000% of GDP
     - Interest payments exceed 100% of GDP
     - System becomes unsustainable
   - **Conclusion**: Under Loanable Funds, sustained deficits cause inevitable crisis

#### Part B: Building the Endogenous Money Model

**Key Principle**: In BOMD, both private and government debt are ASSETS of the banking system.

1. **Restructure the Tables**
   - **Private Banks Table**:
     - Assets: Reserves, **DebtFirms**, **DebtGov**
     - Liabilities: Households, Firms
     - Equity: BanksEquity
   - **Households Table**:
     - Assets: Households (deposits only)
     - Liabilities: None
     - Equity: HHEquity
   - **Firms Table**:
     - Assets: Firms (deposits)
     - Liabilities: None (debt is now bank asset!)
     - Equity: FirmsEquity
   - **Central Bank Table**:
     - Assets: None
     - Liabilities: Reserves, Government
     - Equity: CBEquity
   - **Treasury Table**:
     - Assets: Government (at Central Bank)
     - Liabilities: DebtGov (to private banks)
     - Equity: TreasuryEquity

2. **Modify the Flows**
   - **Wages**: Firms → Households (same as before)
   - **Consumption**: Households → Firms (same as before)
   - **Credit**: Now creates BOTH:
     - Bank Asset (DebtFirms) increases
     - Firm Liability removed, Firm deposits increase
     - Use same formula: GDP × CreditShare
   - **Interest on Private Debt**: Firms → Banks
     - Use Multiplier: DebtFirms × IntRate
   - **Government Spending**: Government → Firms
     - From Central Bank reserves
   - **Taxation**: Households → Government
     - To Central Bank reserves
   - **Bond Sales**: Creates bank asset
     - DebtGov increases (bank asset)
     - Government account increases
     - Formula: (SpendGov - Tax) + (DebtGov × IntRate)
   - **Interest on Bonds**: Government → Banks
     - Use Multiplier: DebtGov × IntRate
   - **Remove Fees**: Not needed in this model

3. **Key Differences in Implementation**
   - In Private Banks Godly Table:
     - Credit flow goes to DebtFirms (Asset column)
     - Bonds flow goes to DebtGov (Asset column)
   - In Firms Godly Table:
     - Credit flow goes to Firms deposits (Asset column)
     - No DebtFirms liability column
   - Money creation formula:
     - dMoney/dt = Credit + (SpendGov + IntGov - Tax)

4. **Run with Same 1% Deficit**
   - Set SpendRate = 0.21, TaxRate = 0.2
   - Run simulation for 200+ years
   - Observe:
     - GDP grows steadily
     - Government debt/GDP ratio **stabilizes** (around 100%)
     - Interest payments remain manageable fraction of GDP
     - **No crisis occurs!**

5. **Analyze the Key Insight**
   - Display sectoral balances using Pie Chart:
     - Private sector equity
     - Government equity (negative)
   - Use Adder to verify:
     - Private Sector Surplus = Government Deficit
     - dPrivateEquity/dt = SpendGov + IntGov - Tax
     - Government "debt" IS private sector wealth

#### Part C: Comparing the Models Side-by-Side

1. **Create Two Parallel Simulations**
   - Save Loanable Funds model as "LF_Model.txt"
   - Save Endogenous Money model as "BOMD_Model.txt"
   - Use separate Scope elements for each

2. **Key Metrics to Compare**
   - Debt/GDP ratio over time
   - Interest payments/GDP ratio
   - Private sector wealth
   - System stability

3. **Add Stop Time Elements**
   - Set stop at year 50, 100, 150, 200
   - Compare states at each checkpoint
   - Use Pie Charts to show distribution changes

#### Part D: Real-World Implications

1. **Model Policy Scenarios**
   - **Austerity**: Reduce SpendRate in both models
     - Loanable Funds: Slows crisis but doesn't prevent it
     - BOMD: Reduces private sector wealth growth
   - **Debt Jubilee**: Reset DebtGov to zero
     - Loanable Funds: Temporary relief only
     - BOMD: Destroys private sector assets!
   - **Inflation**: Add price level dynamics (Tutorial 6)

2. **Understanding the Bank of England Position**
   - Quote display: "Bank lending creates deposits" (McLeay et al. 2014)
   - Quote display: "Rather than banks receiving deposits... bank lending creates deposits"
   - Model validates the BOMD view

3. **The Accounting Identity**
   - Use Current Transactions Matrix to verify:
     - Sum of all financial assets = 0 (conservation law)
     - Government deficit = Private surplus (by identity)
     - Every liability is someone's asset

#### Key Learning Points

1. **Structural Differences**
   - Loanable Funds: Loans don't appear on bank balance sheet as assets
   - BOMD: Loans are bank assets, deposits are bank liabilities
   - This structural difference drives completely different dynamics

2. **Money Creation**
   - Loanable Funds: Money supply fixed (just redistributed)
   - BOMD: Money supply grows with credit and government deficits
   - Formula: dM/dt = Credit + (SpendGov + IntGov - Tax)

3. **Government Deficits**
   - Loanable Funds: Deficits crowd out private sector
   - BOMD: Deficits ADD to private sector wealth
   - Identity: ΔPrivateEquity = -(ΔGovEquity)

4. **Policy Implications**
   - If Loanable Funds is correct: Cut spending urgently
   - If BOMD is correct: Deficits support private economy
   - Evidence strongly supports BOMD (Bank of England, Bundesbank)

#### Advanced Extensions

1. **Add Bank Equity Dynamics**
   - Banks can fail if equity becomes negative
   - Model capital adequacy ratios
   - Use Percent Meter: BankEquity / (DebtFirms + DebtGov)

2. **Multiple Interest Rates**
   - Different rates for private vs. government debt
   - Risk premiums based on debt ratios
   - Use Equation element for nonlinear rate functions

3. **Central Bank Policy**
   - Quantitative easing: CB buys government bonds
   - Reserve requirements
   - Interest on reserves

4. **International Trade**
   - Add foreign sector (Tutorial 7)
   - Twin deficits hypothesis
   - Exchange rate effects

#### Exercise: Test Your Understanding

Build both models from scratch and verify:
1. Under Loanable Funds, can you find ANY deficit level that's sustainable long-term?
2. Under BOMD, what happens if government runs a surplus?
3. What happens in each model if banks stop lending (Credit → 0)?
4. Can you identify which model matches real-world central bank operations?

### Tutorial 6: Debt Dynamics and Stability

Explore how debt levels evolve and affect economic stability.

#### Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis

1. **Model Debt Service Ratio**
   - Use Divider: Debt Service / Income
   - Use Percent Meter to display as percentage
   - Critical threshold: typically 30-40%

2. **Three Borrower Types**
   - **Hedge**: Income covers debt service
   - **Speculative**: Income covers interest only
   - **Ponzi**: Income doesn't cover interest

3. **Build Debt Accumulation**
   - Use Integrator for debt stock
   - New borrowing flow
   - Debt service flow
   - Interest rate (Multiply by Constant)

4. **Observe Instability**
   - Start with low debt ratios
   - Watch debt compound over time
   - System becomes unstable as ratios increase
   - Use Stop Time element to pause at critical points
