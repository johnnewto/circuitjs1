# Money from First Principles

**Understanding Banking Models and Government Deficits**  
*Based on Steve Keen's analysis for engineers*

## Introduction: First Principles vs. Reasoning by Analogy

> "Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation" - Elon Musk

This principle of **first-principles reasoning** means:

> "You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, 'OK, what are we sure is true, or as sure as possible is true?' Then you reason up from there."

Many economic conclusions about government finances are based on **reasoning by analogy**: applying what works for individuals or households to governments. But what if this analogy is false?

Common claims:
- "America is going bankrupt extremely quickly"
- "If we don't fix the deficit, everything will suffer"
- "A country is no different from an individual—if an individual overspends, they go bankrupt, and so can a country"

**The First Principle of Money**: Every monetary transaction involves two parties (payer and payee), and the sum of any single transaction is **zero**.

## The Accounting Foundation

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping: The Law of Money

Almost a millennium ago, Venetian traders developed double-entry bookkeeping:

> "All the creditors must appear in the Ledger at the right-hand side, and all the debtors at the left. All entries made in the Ledger have to be double entries—that is, if you make one creditor, you must make someone debtor." - Luca Pacioli (1494)

**To paraphrase Musk**: With respect to money, **double-entry bookkeeping is the law, and everything else is fraud.**

### The Accounting Equation

The conservation law of accounting:

$$\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} - \text{Equity} = 0 \quad (1)$$

For financial assets (claims between entities), this leads to an economic system-wide conservation law:

**The sum of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.**

This enables monetary macroeconomic analysis by aggregating billions of transactions.

## Transaction Tables (Godley Tables)

A simple transaction table for Private Banks:

| Flows↓/Stock Vars → | Reserves | Households | Firms | Equity | BanksEquity | A-L-E |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Initial Conditions** | 100 | 20 | 70 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| **Pay Wages** | 0 | Wages | -Wages | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Consumption** | 0 | -Consume | Consume | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **∫ Flows** | 100+∫(flows) | 20+∫(flows) | 70+∫(flows) | 10+∫(flows) | 0 | 0 |

The bottom row shows the accumulation of flow transactions over time, this is the value of the stock at any time. 
The calculation is done at each time step by calculating the sum of all the flow values in that column, and than adding the sum to the current value of the stock. 
This can be likened to a number of pipes flows of water into a tank, the tank accumulates or integrates all the flows over time. 
Banks will do this accumulation step once every day.

### Rate of Change or Differential Equations

The rate of change of each stock is the symbolic sum of the relevant column:

$$\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume - Wages$$

$$\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages - Consume$$

$$\frac{dFirms_{Equity}}{dt} = Consume - Wages \quad (2)$$

$$\frac{dHH_{Equity}}{dt} = Wages - Consume$$

$$\frac{dBanks_{Equity}}{dt} = 0$$

$$\frac{dReserves}{dt} = 0$$

$$\frac{dCB_{Equity}}{dt} = 0$$

These equations can be implemented in CircuitJS using Godly Tables, consisting of Flows on the rows, Stocks on the columns. The bottom row value is the integration of all the flows of that column.

This makes it possible to develop economic models with these tables, by defining these flows in terms of each other and relevant parameters. Here we implement this in CircuitJS, using the same approach as Matlab does with Simulink: flowcharts are used to generate equations for numerical simulation.
The circuit to the left implements the following equations

Parameters and flows:

$$Wage_{share} = 0.6; \quad V_{Firms} = 2; \quad V_{HH} = 4$$

$$GDP = {Firms} \times {V_{Firms}}$$

$$Wages = GDP \times Wage_{share}$$

$$Consume = {Households} \times {V_{HH}} \quad (3)$$

$$Credit = GDP \times Credit_{share}$$

$$Interest = Debt_{Firms} \times Int_{rate}$$

$V_{Firms}$ and $V_{HH}$ is the velocity or rate of firms and householders money spending, the rate at which their money is exchanged in one year.


Note that in this economics system there is no money creation or credit. 
The existing money is merely moved around and the total sum of money remains the same at $100 with only $90 in the economy at one time, with wages and consumption flows at ~ $83 per yr.


Adjusting the slider for the Firms spend rate $V_{Firms}$ will change the allocation of money and GDP.

    }, 2000);
  });
</script>

This system is **sustainable** with only private sector debt.



## Two Competing Models of Banking

The answer to whether deficits cause crises depends entirely on which model of banking is correct:


### 1. Loanable Funds Model

**Core Assumption**: Banks are intermediaries between savers and borrowers.

From mainstream textbooks:

> "Commercial banks are the best-known type of financial intermediary. They take deposits from savers and use these deposits to make loans to those who have investment projects they need to finance." - Mankiw (2016)

**Key Characteristic**: Loans appear as:
- **Assets of Households** (who are the real lenders)
- **Liabilities of Firms** (borrowers)
- **NOT on bank balance sheets** as assets

#### Godley Table Structure (Loanable Funds)

Complete analysis requires four tables (Banks, Households, Firms, Central Bank) with each transaction appearing four times.
**Private Banks:**
- Assets: Reserves
- Liabilities: Households, Firms  
- Equity: BanksEquity

**Households:**
- Assets: Households (deposits), **DebtFirms** (loans to firms)
- Liabilities: None
- Equity: HHEquity

**Firms:**
- Assets: Firms (deposits)
- Liabilities: **DebtFirms** (borrowed from households)
- Equity: FirmsEquity

#### Basic Flows (Without Government)

Parameters and flows:

$$Wage_{share} = 0.6; \quad \tau_{Firms} = 0.25; \quad \tau_{HH} = 0.5$$

$$GDP = \frac{Firms}{\tau_{Firms}}$$

$$Wages = GDP \times Wage_{share}$$

$$Consume = \frac{Households}{\tau_{HH}} \quad (3)$$

$$Credit = GDP \times Credit_{share}$$

$$Interest = Debt_{Firms} \times Int_{rate}$$

This system is **sustainable** with only private sector debt.

#### Adding Government Sector

New flows required:
- **Tax**: Households → Government  
$$Tax = GDP \times Tax_{rate}$$
- **Government Spending**: Government → Firms  
$$Spend_{Gov} = GDP \times Spend_{rate}$$
- **Bond Sales**: Households → Government  
$$Bonds = (Spend_{Gov} - Tax) + (Debt_{Gov} \times Int_{rate})$$
- **Interest on Bonds**: Government → Households  
$$Int_{Gov} = Debt_{Gov} \times Int_{rate}$$

#### Differential Equations (Loanable Funds with Government)

$$\frac{dDebt_{Gov}}{dt} = Bonds$$

$$\frac{dDebt_{Firms}}{dt} = Credit$$

$$\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume + Credit + Spend_{Banks} + Spend_{Gov} - Wages - Int_{Firms}$$

$$\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages + Int_{Gov} + Int_{Firms} - Consume - Credit - Fee - Tax + Bonds \quad (4)$$

$$\frac{dGovernment}{dt} = Tax + Bonds - Spend_{Gov} - Int_{Gov}$$

$$\frac{dBanks}{dt} = Fee - Spend_{Banks}$$

#### Result: Inevitable Crisis

Running with 1% deficit (Spend = 21% GDP, Tax = 20% GDP):

- Government debt → 2,000% of GDP (over 200 years)
- Interest payments → 100% of GDP
- System becomes **unsustainable**

**Conclusion**: Under Loanable Funds, sustained deficits cause inevitable fiscal crisis.

### 2. Endogenous Money Model (BOMD)

**BOMD** = Bank-Originated Money and Debt

**Core Assumption**: Banks create money by creating debt.

Endorsed by central banks after 2008:

**Bank of England:**
> "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, **bank lending creates deposits.**" - McLeay, Radia, and Thomas (2014)

**Bundesbank:**
> "A bank can grant loans without any prior inflows of customer deposits. In fact, book money is created as a result of an accounting entry: when a bank grants a loan, it posts the associated credit entry for the customer as a sight deposit..."

**Key Characteristic**: Both private and government debt are **ASSETS of the banking system**.

#### Godley Table Structure (BOMD)

**Private Banks:**
- Assets: Reserves, **DebtFirms**, **DebtGov**
- Liabilities: Households, Firms
- Equity: BanksEquity

**Households:**
- Assets: Households (deposits **only**)
- Liabilities: None
- Equity: HHEquity

**Firms:**
- Assets: Firms (deposits)
- Liabilities: None (debt is now bank asset!)
- Equity: FirmsEquity

**Central Bank:**
- Assets: None
- Liabilities: Reserves, Government
- Equity: CBEquity

**Treasury:**
- Assets: Government (at Central Bank)
- Liabilities: DebtGov (to private banks)
- Equity: TreasuryEquity

#### Key Structural Difference

In BOMD, **money creation occurs on the Asset side** of bank balance sheets:

- Credit creates DebtFirms (bank asset) + Firm deposits
- Bond sales create DebtGov (bank asset) + Government account
- In Loanable Funds, all operations are on Liabilities/Equity side (cancel out)

#### Differential Equations (BOMD)

$$\frac{dDebt_{Gov}}{dt} = Bonds$$

$$\frac{dDebt_{Firms}}{dt} = Credit$$

$$\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume + Credit + Spend_{Gov} - Wages - Int_{Firms}$$

$$\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages - Consume - Tax \quad (5)$$

$$\frac{dGovernment}{dt} = Tax + Bonds - Int_{Gov} - Spend_{Gov}$$

$$\frac{dReserves}{dt} = Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax - Bonds$$

$$\frac{dBanks}{dt} = Int_{Gov} + Int_{Firms} - Spend_{Gov}$$

#### Money Creation Formula

The rate of change of money supply:

$$\frac{dMoney}{dt} = Credit + (Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax) \quad (6)$$

The bracketed term is government money creation.

#### Result: Stable System

Running with same 1% deficit (Spend = 21% GDP, Tax = 20% GDP):

- GDP grows steadily
- Government debt/GDP ratio **stabilizes** (~100%)
- Interest payments remain manageable
- **No crisis occurs!**

**Conclusion**: Under BOMD, sustained deficits do not cause fiscal crisis.

## The Fundamental Identity

### Sectoral Balances

The change in Treasury equity:

$$\frac{dTreasury_{Equity}}{dt} = Tax - (Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov}) \quad (7)$$

The change in Private sector equity (Banks + Firms + Households):

$$\frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} = (Wages - Consume) + (Consume + Spend_{Gov} - Int_{Firms} - Wages) + (Int_{Firms} + Int_{Gov} - Tax)$$

Terms cancel to leave:

$$\frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} = Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax \quad (8)$$

### The Key Insight

Comparing equations (7) and (8):

$$\boxed{\frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} = -\frac{dTreasury_{Equity}}{dt}}$$

**Government deficit = Private sector surplus (by accounting identity)**

In the BOMD model:
- Government "debt" IS private sector wealth
- Government deficit ADDS to private sector equity
- This is not a theory—it's an accounting identity

<div id="implementation" class="circuit-section" data-name="CircuitJS Implementation" data-circuit="../circuitjs.html?startCircuit=implementation.txt&editable=false">

### Building the Loanable Funds Model

1. **Create Godly Tables** for each sector
   - Banks: Reserves, Households, Firms as columns
   - Households: Households, DebtFirms as assets
   - Firms: Firms as asset, DebtFirms as liability
   - Treasury: Government as asset, DebtGov as liability

2. **Define Parameters**
   - WageShare = 0.6
   - τFirms = 0.25
   - τHH = 0.5
   - IntRate = 0.05
   - CreditShare = 0.5
   - TaxRate = 0.20
   - SpendRate = 0.21 (for 1% deficit)

3. **Create Flow Equations**
   - GDP = Firms / τFirms (use Divider)
   - Wages = GDP × WageShare (use Multiplier)
   - Consume = Households / τHH (use Divider)
   - Credit = GDP × CreditShare (use Multiplier)
   - Tax = GDP × TaxRate (use Multiplier)
   - SpendGov = GDP × SpendRate (use Multiplier)
   - Bonds = (SpendGov - Tax) + DebtGov × IntRate (use Adder)

4. **Monitor Key Metrics**
   - Scope: DebtGov / GDP ratio
   - Scope: IntGov / GDP ratio
   - Pie Chart: Sectoral balances

</div> <!-- end circuit-section -->

### Building the BOMD Model

1. **Restructure Tables**
   - Banks: Add DebtFirms and DebtGov as **Assets**
   - Households: Remove DebtFirms (only deposits)
   - Firms: Remove DebtFirms liability
   - Add Central Bank table
   - Treasury: Government at Central Bank

2. **Modify Flows**
   - Credit now increases bank assets (DebtFirms)
   - Bonds now increase bank assets (DebtGov)
   - Interest flows to Banks, not Households
   - Government account at Central Bank

3. **Same Parameters** as Loanable Funds

4. **Compare Results**
   - Run both models side-by-side
   - Observe debt/GDP trajectories
   - Verify stability differences



## Implementing in CircuitJS
### Visualization Tips

- **Current Transactions Matrix**: Shows all flows between sectors
- **Scope Elements**: Plot debt ratios over time (50-200 years)
- **Pie Charts**: Display sectoral equity distribution
- **Stop Time Elements**: Pause at key checkpoints (50, 100, 150, 200 years)
- **Percent Meters**: Show debt/GDP and interest/GDP ratios

## Policy Implications

### If Loanable Funds is Correct:
- Government deficits crowd out private investment
- Debt accumulation is unsustainable
- Austerity is necessary to avoid crisis
- Government must "live within its means"

### If BOMD is Correct:
- Government deficits add to private sector wealth
- Debt/GDP ratio stabilizes naturally
- Austerity reduces private sector equity
- Government cannot "run out of money" (for fiat currency issuer)

### The Evidence

Central bank endorsements:
- **Bank of England** (2014): "Bank lending creates deposits"
- **Bundesbank** (2017): "A bank can grant loans without any prior inflows"

Empirical observation:
- Banks create loans and deposits simultaneously
- Government spending precedes taxation operationally
- Countries with sovereign currencies never "run out of money"

**Conclusion**: Evidence strongly supports BOMD model.

## Advanced Topics

### Money Supply Growth

In BOMD, money supply grows through:

$$\frac{dM}{dt} = \underbrace{Credit}_{\text{Private}} + \underbrace{(Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax)}_{\text{Government}}$$

Both private lending and government deficits create money.

### Price Level Dynamics

Adding inflation requires price equation:

$$\frac{dP}{dt} = P \times \left(\frac{Demand - Supply}{Supply}\right) \times \text{adjustment speed}$$

Where:
- Demand includes consumption, investment, government spending
- Supply is productive capacity
- Inflation occurs when demand exceeds supply

### International Trade

Adding foreign sector:

$$\frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} = \underbrace{(Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax)}_{\text{Fiscal}} + \underbrace{(Exports - Imports)}_{\text{Trade}}$$

The sectoral balances identity becomes:

$$\text{Government Balance} + \text{Private Balance} + \text{Foreign Balance} = 0$$

### Capital Adequacy

Banks require minimum equity ratios:

$$\text{Capital Adequacy Ratio} = \frac{Banks_{Equity}}{Debt_{Firms} + Debt_{Gov}} \geq \text{minimum (e.g., 8\%)}$$

Model bank failures when equity becomes negative.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build Both Models

Construct Loanable Funds and BOMD models in CircuitJS:
1. Verify accounting identities hold
2. Run with 1% deficit for 200 years
3. Compare debt/GDP trajectories
4. Identify which matches real-world behavior

### Exercise 2: Parameter Sensitivity

Test different scenarios:
1. What deficit level is sustainable in Loanable Funds? (Answer: None!)
2. What happens if government runs surplus in BOMD?
3. Effect of different interest rates on debt dynamics
4. Impact of credit growth rates on money supply

### Exercise 3: Policy Experiments

Model policy changes:
1. **Austerity**: Reduce SpendRate from 21% to 20%
   - Compare effects in both models
   - Observe private sector equity changes
2. **Debt Jubilee**: Reset DebtGov to zero
   - In Loanable Funds: Temporary relief
   - In BOMD: Destroys private assets!
3. **Quantitative Easing**: Central Bank buys bonds from private banks
   - Changes DebtGov holder but not magnitude

### Exercise 4: Real-World Data

Compare model outputs to actual data:
1. US debt/GDP ratio (1950-2025)
2. Interest payments as % of GDP
3. Private sector wealth vs. government debt
4. Test which model fits better

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structure Matters**: The location of debt on balance sheets (Loanable Funds vs. BOMD) completely changes system dynamics

2. **Accounting Identity**: Government deficit = Private sector surplus (always true, regardless of model)

3. **Money Creation**: In BOMD, both credit and government deficits create money; in Loanable Funds, money is only redistributed

4. **Crisis Predictions**: 
   - Loanable Funds → inevitable crisis with sustained deficits
   - BOMD → stable debt/GDP ratio with sustained deficits

5. **Evidence**: Central banks endorse BOMD model; real-world operations match BOMD, not Loanable Funds

6. **Policy Implications**: Believing the wrong model leads to harmful policies (e.g., austerity reducing private wealth)
