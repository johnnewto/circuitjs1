   - Navigate to: **Active Components > LED**
   - Place the LED in your circuit

5. **Make Connections**
   - Click on the positive terminal of the voltage source

   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the LED anode (positive)
   - Connect the LED cathode (negative) back to the voltage source negative terminal

6. **Run the Simulation**
   - Press **Space** or click the play button

### Tutorial 2: RC Timing Circuit

Build a circuit that demonstrates capacitor charging and discharging.

#### Components Needed
- 12V DC voltage source
- 1kΩ resistor
- 100µF capacitor
- Switch
- Voltmeter or scope probe

#### Circuit Construction

1. **Build the Basic RC Circuit**
   - Place voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series
   - Add a switch in series to control the circuit

2. **Add Measurement**
   - Right-click on the capacitor
   - Select **View in Scope** to monitor voltage
   - Or add a voltmeter across the capacitor

3. **Observe Charging**
   - Close the switch
   - Watch the capacitor voltage rise exponentially
   - Note the time constant τ = RC = 1kΩ × 100µF = 0.1 seconds

4. **Observe Discharging**
   - Add a second switch to discharge the capacitor through a resistor
   - Watch the exponential decay

#### Key Learning Points
- **Time Constant**: τ = RC determines charging/discharging speed
- **63% Rule**: Capacitor reaches 63% of final voltage in one time constant
- **Exponential Behavior**: Charging follows 1 - e^(-t/τ), discharging follows e^(-t/τ)

### Tutorial 3: Op-Amp Basics

Learn operational amplifier fundamentals with a non-inverting amplifier.

#### Theory Review
- Op-amps have very high gain (ideally infinite)
- **Golden Rules**: 
  1. No current flows into the inputs
  2. The op-amp tries to make both inputs equal

#### Building the Circuit

1. **Add the Op-Amp**
   - Use **Active Components > Op-Amp (ideal)**
   - This gives us perfect characteristics for learning

2. **Create the Feedback Network**
   - Connect a 10kΩ resistor from output to inverting input (-)
   - Connect a 1kΩ resistor from inverting input to ground

3. **Add Input Signal**
   - Connect an AC voltage source (1V, 1kHz) to the non-inverting input (+)

4. **Power Supply**
   - Connect ±15V supplies to the op-amp power pins

5. **Measure Output**
   - Use scope to monitor both input and output

#### Expected Results
- **Gain**: (R1 + R2) / R2 = (10k + 1k) / 1k = 11
- **Output**: 11V peak-to-peak sine wave
- **Phase**: Input and output are in phase (non-inverting)
