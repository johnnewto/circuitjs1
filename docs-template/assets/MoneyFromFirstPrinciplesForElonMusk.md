## 1\. Introduction

"Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation"¹ is one of Elon Musk's best-known phrases.

This, he says, leads him to practice "First Principles" reasoning, which is:

> a physics way of looking at the world you boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, "OK, what are we sure is true, or as sure as possible is true?" Then you reason up from there.

Elon Musk X @elonmusk: Reasoning from first principles is a superpower
"Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy." - Elon Musk

In that same interview, Musk criticized the alternative of reasoning by analogy:

> It's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. "We're doing this because it's like something else..."²

Musk is now involved in the economics of government finances—or was involved, before the bizarre events triggered by the "Big Beautiful Bill"—where he has made numerous comments like the following:

> America is headed for disaster, with no money for anything, unless the government overspending is addressed.³
> If we don't fix the deficit, everything will suffer, including essential spending like DoD, Medicare & Social Security. It's not optional.⁴

-----

"If the deficit is not brought under control, America will go bankrupt. This is a very important thing for people to understand. A country is no different from an individual in that if an individual overspends, an individual can go bankrupt, and so can a country.⁵"

These conclusions are based on **reasoning by analogy**, by applying what applies to an individual, a household or a firm to a government. It could be that the analogy holds, but what if it does not? The consequences of acting on a false analogy are bound to be negative.

Instead of arguing by analogy ("economics is like physics"), you need to base your analysis on the fundamental truth of money: that every monetary transaction involves two parties—the payer and the payee—and that the sum of any single transaction is zero.

Almost a millennia ago, Venetian traders worked out that this process could be tracked by what we now call double-entry bookkeeping:

> 'All the creditors must appear in the Ledger at the right-hand side, and all the debtors at the left. All entries made in the Ledger have to be double entries—that is, if you make one creditor, you must make someone debtor.' - *Luca Pacioli as cited in (Gleeson-White 2011, p. 91)⁶*

Today, all businesses and banks manage their finances via double-entry bookkeeping. To paraphrase Musk's quip about physics, with respect to money, **double-entry bookkeeping is the law, and everything else is fraud.**

Analyzing the economy using double-entry bookkeeping results in vastly different conclusions about how the economy should be managed than those that Musk is currently reaching by reasoning from analogy.

## 2\. The First Principles of Money

Double-entry bookkeeping has a conservation law, which accountants call "the Accounting Equation". They express this as "Assets equal Liabilities plus Equity", but it is better expressed in conservation form:

$$\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} - \text{Equity} = 0 \quad (1)$$

When restricted to financial assets—which are claims that an entity has on other entities—this leads to an economic-system-wide conservation law: \*\*the sum of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.\*\*⁷

This can be used to enable monetary macroeconomic analysis, by aggregating the many billions of transactions that occur over a year.

**Figure 3: A simple transactions table for Private Banks**

| Flows/Stock Vars → | Reserves | Households | Firms | Equity | BankSEquity | A-L-E |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Initial Conditions** | 100 | 20 | 70 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| **Pay Wages** | | Wages | -Wages | | | 0 |
| **Consumption** | | -Consume | Consume | | | 0 |

To show the transactions fully from the point of view of every entity involved in it requires four tables—one for each of Banks, Households, Firms and the Central Bank—in which each transaction appears four times (Figure 4).

**Figure 4: The full set of transaction tables**

**Private Banks**

| Flows/Stock Vars → | Reserves | Households | Firms | Equity | BankSEquity | A-L-E |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Initial Conditions | 100 | 20 | 70 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| Pay Wages | | Wages | -Wages | | | 0 |
| Consumption | | -Consume | Consume | | | 0 |

**Households**

| Flows / Stock Vars → | Households | $HH_{Equity}$ | A-L-E |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Initial Conditions | 20 | 20 | 0 |
| Consumption | -Consume | -Consume | 0 |
| Pay Wages | Wages | Wages | 0 |

**Firms**

| Flows/Stock Vars → | Firms | $FirmSEquity$ | A-L-E |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Initial Conditions | 70 | 70 | 0 |
| Consumption | Consume | Consume | 0 |
| Pay Wages | -Wages | -Wages | 0 |

**Central Bank**

| Flows/Stock Vars → | Reserves | $CB_{Equity}$ | A-L-E |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Initial Conditions | 100 | -100 | 0 |

These tables can be used to generate a system of differential equations describing the dynamics of money. The rate of change of each stock is the symbolic sum of the relevant column:

$$
\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume - Wages
$$

$$
\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages - Consume
$$

$$
\frac{dFirms_{Equity}}{dt} = Consume - Wages
$$

$$
\frac{dHH_{Equity}}{dt} = Wages - Consume \quad (2)
$$

$$
\frac{dBanks_{Equity}}{dt} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{dReserves}{dt} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{dCB_{Equity}}{dt} = 0
$$

I have implemented this in my program **Ravel**, using the same approach as Matlab does with Simulink: flowcharts are used to generate equations for numerical simulation.⁸ Ravel is available from [https://www.patreon.com/ravelation](https://www.patreon.com/ravelation). Its price is $2/month for the version which enables simulations, and $10/month for the version which also includes data analysis.

**Figure 5: The flowchart equations needed to enable simulation of the model in Equation (2)**
*(Stocks and flows are shown in red, and parameters in blue:)*

```
Firms 70.0
+%
GDP 140

Profits 56.0
TFirms 500 x 10⁻³
600
Wageshare
Wages 84.0 x 10⁻³
Households 20.0
250 THH x 10⁻³
Consume 80.0
```

Ravel generates the equations shown in Equation (3) from the flowchart equations in Figure 5:
*Fraction and Year* (Top Header)
*Dollars per Year* (Top Header)

$$
Wage_{share} = 0.6; \tau_{Firms} = 0.5; \tau_{HH} = 0.25
$$

$$
GDP = \frac{Firms}{\tau_{Firms}}
$$

$$
Wages = GDP \times Wage_{share}
$$

$$
Profits = GDP - Wages
$$

$$
Consume = \frac{Households}{\tau_{HH}} \quad (3)
$$

Parameters can be varied during a simulation run (Figure 6).

This technology can be used to assess the claim that Musk (and many others) have made, that America faces a crisis unless government spending is reduced:

> America is going bankrupt extremely quickly. The interest payments on the national debt just exceeded the defense budget. They are over a trillion dollars a year just in interest and rising.¹¹

The answer depends on which model of the monetary system you believe describes the real world. There are two opposing models of banking used by economists:

  * **Loanable Funds**, in which banks function as intermediaries between savers and borrowers.
  * **“Endogenous money”** (which I call **BOMD**), in which banks create money by creating debt.

The crisis Musk envisages is inevitable under Loanable Funds.

## 3\. Loanable Funds

In the model of banking known as Loanable Funds, banks act as intermediaries between savers (households) and borrowers (firms):

> a financial intermediary stands between the two sides of the market and helps move financial resources toward their best use. Commercial banks are the best-known type of financial intermediary. They take deposits from savers and use these deposits to make loans to those who have investment projects they need to finance. - *(Mankiw 2016, p. 593)*

> Saving is the supply of loanable funds—households lend their saving to investors or deposit their saving in a bank that then loans the funds out. Investment is the demand for loanable funds—investors borrow from the public directly by selling bonds or indirectly by borrowing from banks. - *(Mankiw 2016, pp. 72)*

Loans do not appear on the bank's ledger in this model; they are assets of the Household sector and liabilities of the Firms.

**Figure 7:** *Loanable Funds without Government Bank Godley Table*
**Figure 8:** *The Households Godley Table*

The model's initial values and equations are:

```
HH Rate = 0.08; Int Rate = 0.05; Fee Frac = 0.1; Credit Share = 0.5; Firms Share = 1
Firms Rate = 1
Banks Rate = 1
Wage Share = 0.6;
τHH = 0.5; τFirms = 0.25; τBanks = 1

Wages = GDP × Wage Share
Consume = Households / τHH
Credit = GDP × Credit Share
Int = DebtFirms × Int Rate
Fee = Int × Fee Frac
Banks Spend = Banks / τBanks
Firms Spend = Firms / τFirms (4)
```

**Figure 9: Loanable Funds with only private sector debt**
This system is sustainable.

A government sector is added by:

  * Adding a Government deposit account as an additional Liability for Private Banks.
  * Adding $Debt_{Gov}$ as an additional Asset for the Household Sector.
  * Adding the flows of government spending, taxation, bond sales, and interest payments on outstanding government bonds.

**Figure 10: Additional flows for Banks, Households and Firms¹³**

A new Godley Table is required for the Treasury. The Government account is an Asset of the Treasury, and government debt (bonds sold to households) is its liability.

**Figure 11: The Treasury Godley Table**

The differential equations for this system are:

$$
\frac{dDebt_{Gov}}{dt} = Bonds
$$

$$
\frac{dDebt_{Firms}}{dt} = Credit
$$

$$
\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume + Credit + Spend_{Banks} + Spend_{Gov} - Wages - Int_{Firms}
$$

$$
\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages + Int_{Gov} + Int_{Firms} - Consume - Credit - Fee - Tax + Bonds
$$

$$
\frac{dGovernment}{dt} = Tax + Bonds - Spend_{Gov} - Int_{Bonds}
$$

$$
\frac{dBanks}{dt} = Fee + Spend_{Gov} \quad (5)
$$

**Figure 12** *shows the standard requirement that the government must sell bonds equivalent to the value of the Deficit, plus interest on existing bonds.*

**Figure 13: A simulation with a Deficit of 1% of GDP**
This simulation shows the system is **clearly unsustainable**: government debt hits 2,000% of GDP, and interest payments exceed 100% of GDP. Under the **Loanable Funds** model, a fiscal crisis is inevitable if the government habitually runs a deficit.

## 4\. Endogenous Money

Advocates of the **BOMD** (Bank-Originated Money and Debt) model reject Loanable Funds. Banks are not intermediaries but loan originators. This was endorsed by the Bank of England and the Bundesbank after the Global Financial Crisis.

The Bank of England:

> Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, **bank lending creates deposits.** - *(McLeay, Radia, and Thomas 2014, p. 14)*

The Bundesbank:

> A bank can grant loans without any prior inflows of customer deposits. In fact, book money is created as a result of an accounting entry: when a bank grants a loan, it posts the associated credit entry for the customer as a sight deposit by the latter and therefore as a liability on the liability side of its own balance sheet. - *(Deutsche Bundesbank 2017, pp. 13, 17)*

The Loanable Funds model is edited for BOMD so that:

  * Both $Debt_{Firms}$ and $Debt_{Gov}$ are Assets of the Private Banks.
  * The Government account is a liability of the Central Bank.
  * Interest payments are made to Banks.
  * Fees are deleted.

**Figure 14: The altered Godley Tables for Private Banks, the Central Bank, and Households**

Running this model with a sustained 1% of GDP deficit:
**Figure 15: Endogenous money with a sustained 1% of GDP Deficit**
In this model, private bank accounts and GDP grow, and the government debt to GDP level stabilizes. **There is no crisis.**

The differential equations of this model are:

$$
\frac{dDebt_{Gov}}{dt} = Bonds
$$

$$
\frac{dDebt_{Firms}}{dt} = Credit
$$

$$
\frac{dFirms}{dt} = Consume + Credit + Spend_{Gov} - Wages - Int_{Firms}
$$

$$
\frac{dHouseholds}{dt} = Wages - Consume - Tax
$$

$$
\frac{dGovernment}{dt} = Tax + Bonds - Int_{Gov} - Spend_{Gov}
$$

$$
\frac{dReserves}{dt} = Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Bonds} - Tax - Bonds
$$

$$
\frac{dBanks}{dt} = Int_{Gov} + Int_{Firms} - Spend_{Gov} \quad (6)
$$

In the Endogenous Money model, five operations occur on the Asset side of the banking sector’s ledger: $Credit$, $Bonds$, $Tax$, $Spend_{Gov}$, and $Int_{Bonds}$. In Loanable Funds, all operations occur only on the Liabilities and Equity side, which cancel out, meaning no money can be created.

In BOMD, operations change the amount of money. The rate of change of the money supply is:

$$
\frac{dMoney}{dt} = Credit + (Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax) \quad (7)
$$

The bracketed term (government money creation) is opposite in sign to the change in equity for the Treasury:

$$
\frac{dTreasury_{Equity}}{dt} = Tax - (Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov}) \quad (8)
$$

The sum of the changes in the equity of Private Banks, Firms and Households ($Private_{Equity}$) is opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to the bracketed government term:

$$
\frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} = (Wages - Consume) + (Consume + Spend_{Gov} - Int_{Firms} - Wages) + (Int_{Firms} + Int_{Gov} - Spend_{Gov})
$$

The terms cancel out to leave:

$$
Spend_{Gov} + Int_{Gov} - Tax = \frac{dPrivate_{Equity}}{dt} \quad (10)
$$
