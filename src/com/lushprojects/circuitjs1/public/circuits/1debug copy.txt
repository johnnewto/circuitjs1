## Bank-Money World Model (BMW)

**Source:** Godley & Lavoie (2007) Chapter 7  
**Based on:** sfcr R package implementation

This model demonstrates **stock-flow consistent (SFC) modeling** of a monetary economy with banks creating money through lending.

### Key Features

- Banks create money by issuing loans
- Households hold deposits and consume
- Firms invest and employ workers
- No government sector (simplified version)

### Key Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Y** | National income (output) |
| **C** | Consumption |
| **I** | Investment |
| **K** | Capital stock |
| **Mh** | Household money holdings |
| **Ld** | Loan demand |

### Steady-State Values

At steady state (t → ∞):
- Y = 160, C = 144, I = 16
- K = 160 (capital-output ratio = 1)
- Mh = Ms = Ld = Ls = 160
