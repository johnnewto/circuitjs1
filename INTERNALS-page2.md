# How the volts Array is Set

The `volts` array in each circuit element stores the voltage at each of its connection nodes (posts). This array is populated through the main circuit simulation process:

## 1. Main Simulation Loop
- [`updateCircuit()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L1502) is the main method called every simulation step
- This calls [`runCircuit()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3021) which performs the actual matrix solving

## 2. Matrix Solution Process
- The simulator uses **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)** to solve the circuit
- It builds a matrix equation: **A Ã— X = B**
- [`lu_solve()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3118) solves this matrix to get node voltages in `circuitRightSide`

## 3. Voltage Distribution
- [`applySolvedRightSide(circuitRightSide)`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3182) processes the solved matrix
- This extracts node voltages and stores them in the global `nodeVoltages[]` array
- Then calls [`setNodeVoltages(nodeVoltages)`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3208) to distribute voltages to elements

## 4. Element Voltage Assignment
- [`setNodeVoltages()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3208) iterates through all circuit nodes
- For each node, it finds all connected elements via [`CircuitNodeLink`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3214)
- Calls [`element.setNodeVoltage(postNumber, voltage)`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CircuitElm.java#L264) on each connected element

## 5. Individual Element Update
- [`CircuitElm.setNodeVoltage(n, c)`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CircuitElm.java#L264) sets `volts[n] = c`
- Then calls [`calculateCurrent()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CircuitElm.java#L270) to update current based on new voltage

## 6. Initialization
- `volts` arrays are initialized to 0 in element constructors
- During `reset()` operations, voltages are typically zeroed out

## Key Flow Summary

lu_solve(matrix) â†’

element.setNodeVoltage() â†’

```
## For Example
In  [`LabeledNodeElm`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/LabeledNodeElm.java), `volts[0]` contains the voltage of the node that this labeled node is connected to, as calculated by the circuit simulation matrix solver. This voltage gets updated every simulation timestep as the circuit state evolves.

This method distributes solved node voltage values from the circuit analysis back to individual circuit elements, essentially propagating the solution throughout the circuit after the Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) matrix has been solved.

## More Details on Voltage Distribution
 [`setNodeVoltages()`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3208) iterates through all circuit nodes
- For each node, it finds all connected elements via [`CircuitNodeLink`](src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/CirSim.java#L3214)


``` java
// set node voltages in each element given an array of node voltages
    void setNodeVoltages(double nv[]) {
        int j, k;
        for (j = 0; j != nv.length; j++) {
            double res = nv[j];
            CircuitNode cn = getCircuitNode(j+1);
            for (k = 0; k != cn.links.size(); k++) {
            CircuitNodeLink cnl = cn.links.elementAt(k);
            cnl.elm.setNodeVoltage(cnl.num, res);
            }
        }
    }
```
The method takes an array nv[] containing the computed node voltages from the matrix solver. The outer loop iterates through each voltage value in this array, where j represents the array index (0-based) and res holds the actual voltage value for that node. A key detail here is that the method calls getCircuitNode(j+1) rather than getCircuitNode(j) - this is because CircuitJS1 uses a 1-based node numbering system where node 0 is reserved for ground, while the voltage array is 0-indexed and doesn't include ground (which is always 0V).

The inner loop handles the fact that multiple circuit elements can be connected to the same node. Each CircuitNode maintains a links collection containing CircuitNodeLink objects that represent connections to specific terminals of circuit elements. For every element connected to the current node, the method calls setNodeVoltage(cnl.num, res) where cnl.num specifies which terminal of the element corresponds to this node, and res provides the voltage value.

This distribution mechanism is crucial because circuit elements need to know the voltages at their terminals to calculate currents, update their internal state, and render themselves correctly. For example, a resistor needs both terminal voltages to determine current flow direction and magnitude, while a diode needs the voltage difference to determine if it's conducting. The method essentially bridges the gap between the global circuit analysis (which works with abstract node numbers) and the local element behavior (which works with specific terminal voltages).


## How Computed Value Propagation Works:
1. Data Flow

```
TableElm Column Sum â†’ LabeledNodeElm.setComputedValue() â†’ labelList[labelName].computedValue â†’ 
CirSim.setNodeVoltages() â†’ getComputedVoltageForNode() â†’ Override wire voltages
```
2. Key Components
In LabeledNodeElm:

LabelEntry.computedValue stores computed values in the existing labelList
setComputedValue() method stores computed values by label name
In CirSim.setNodeVoltages():

Before: res = nv[j] (simulated voltage)
After: Checks getComputedVoltageForNode(j+1) for computed override
If computed value exists: res = computedOverride
Result: All connected wires get the computed voltage
In TableElm:

Column sums call LabeledNodeElm.setComputedValue(columnHeader, sum)
Values stored centrally in labelList instead of JavaScript
3. What This Achieves
âœ… Wire Voltage Override - Wires connected to labeled nodes with computed values show the computed voltage instead of simulated voltage
âœ… Real-time Updates - Happens every simulation timestep via setNodeVoltages()
âœ… Seamless Integration - Works with existing voltage display, multimeters, scopes, etc.
âœ… Multiple Sources - Any element can set computed values, not just TableElm
âœ… Priority System - Computed values override simulated values when present

4. Usage Example
Create a TableElm with column headers like "VCC", "VOUT"
Add LabeledNodeElm elements with matching names ("VCC", "VOUT")
Connect wires to the labeled nodes
TableElm calculates column sums and stores as computed values
All connected wires automatically display the computed sum voltages instead of circuit simulation voltages
5. Benefits
No complex voltage source stamping required
Works with existing infrastructure (wire current calculation, displays, etc.)
Clean separation between computed and simulated values
Easy debugging - computed values visible in labelList
The computed values from your TableElm column sums will now automatically propagate to any wires connected to LabeledNodeElm elements with matching names!
